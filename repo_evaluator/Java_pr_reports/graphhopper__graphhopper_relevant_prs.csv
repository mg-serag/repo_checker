3100,https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/3100,3086,https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/3086,62,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and actionable problem description. It presents a question about handling an exception and proposes apotential solution without detailing the specific requirements or context needed for a developer to act on. This ambiguity violates the criteria for being clear and actionable, making it unsuitable for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, it contains a mixture of information that may complicate comprehension."
3056,https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/3056,2819,https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/2819,238,Bad PR,"The issue appears to lack a clear and actionable description and includes multiple diverse themes (e.g., fixing multiple JSON files, enums, reverting changes) which do not maintain a single issue focus. Additionally, there are references to other issues and discussions, which adds to the vagueness. The content also does not provide a clear, specific problem statement that would enable a developer to start working on it immediately."

It provides relevant context, error messages, and steps to reproduce the problem, fulfilling the criteria for a 'Good PR'. The issue is focused on a single problem and written primarily in English."
