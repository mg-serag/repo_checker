9515,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/9515,8576,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/8576,629,Good PR,"The issue presents two clear and actionable proposals focused on refactoring connector configuration, provides specific benefits, and outlines a concrete task list. It does not involve reverting any changes or asking vague questions, and it maintains a single issue focus. The content is primarily in English, thus meeting all criteria for a 'Good PR'."
9336,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/9336,9278,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/9278,60,Bad PR,"The issue lacks sufficient clarity and specificity regarding the feature request. While it suggests support for two specific formats, it does not provide actionable steps or details on how it would integrate with the existing system. Additionally, it does not focus on a single well-defined problem, as it mentions multiple aspects (cross-VPC costs, use of S3 as a message queue, and processing with Snowflake or Databend) without clearly linking them together. The lack of a usage scenario further hampers its clarity."
8989,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/8989,6896,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/6896,83,Bad PR,"The issue describes an error encountered when running a command but does not clearly define a specific, actionable problem or feature request to be addressed. It lacks clarity on what specific change or fix is needed, and it feels more like a bug report rather than a request for a feature or enhancement. Additionally, it contains a lot of context that distracts from a focused problem, which is not ideal for a 'Good PR'."

8340,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/8340,8138,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/8138,136,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific feature request to support Spark in addition to Flink and Zeta, which is actionable and focused on a single, well-defined problem. It does not request a revert, is not vague, and the content is primarily in English."
8000,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/8000,7925,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/7925,43,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific enhancement needed for the API, providing actionable context about supporting a different format (hocon) for job submissions. It is not a revert, question, or vague request, and it focuses on a single issue. Most of the content is in English, meeting the language requirement."
8044,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/pull/8044,8042,https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/8042,105,Good PR,"The issue effectively describes a specific and actionable problem related to MongoDB Bson conversion errors in the SeaTunnel application. It includes relevant configuration details, error logs, and an example of the MongoDB initialization script, providing sufficient context for a developer to begin working on the fix. Furthermore, it is not a revert, question, or vague request, and it maintains a focus on a singular issue."
