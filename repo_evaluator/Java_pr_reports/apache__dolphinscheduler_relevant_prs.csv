17289,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17289,17288,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/17288,286,Bad PR,"The issue does not provide a clear and actionable description of a specific problem or feature request. It includes some code but lacks a detailed explanation of what the expected behavior is or how to reproduce the issue. Additionally, it does not adhere to the requirement for focusing on a single well-defined problem, and the absence of a 'How to reproduce' section makes it ambiguous."
17243,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17243,17267,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/17267,140,Bad PR,"The issue lacks sufficient detail regarding the specific problem or feature that needs to be addressed. It only states to 'avoid swallowing the exception' without outlining the context, exact changes needed, or the implications of this change. Thus, it does not provide a clear and actionable problem for a developer to start working on."

It avoids vague requests and questions, focuses on a single issue, and is primarily written in English."
17199,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17199,17184,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/17184,412,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly describe a specific, actionable problem. It repeats the same statement about Global Params and output without providing enough context or details for a developer to understand how to address the issue. Additionally, it lacks a clear reproduction scenario or specific error messages, making it vague and difficult to act upon."
17180,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17180,17179,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/17179,503,Bad PR,"The issue requests the removal of a component (GlobalTaskDispatchWaitingQueue) but does not provide a clear justification for why it is considered 'meaningless' or detail the implications of this change. The request does not focus on a single, actionable problem or feature and lacks sufficient context for a developer to start working. Additionally, the phrasing may imply a revert of existing functionality without clear benefits or motivations outlined."
17153,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17153,16767,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16767,37,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific and actionable problem regarding the handling of sub-workflow task instances during a failover process, providing sufficient context for a developer to understand the issue and implement a fix. It is not a request to revert changes, does not pose a question or vague request, focuses on a single issue, and is primarily written in English."

It outlines a design detail for the proposed solution, focusing on a single, well-defined issue rather than asking a question or making a vague request. The content is primarily in English, meeting the language criteria."
17000,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/17000,16999,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16999,117,Bad PR,"The issue is not actionable as it lacks specific details in the 'What you expected to happen' and 'How to reproduce' sections, making it unclear how to address the problem. Additionally, it does not provide enough context for a developer to start work, as the problem is not sufficiently defined. It does mention a specific technical issue, but without actionable steps, it doesn't meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
16998,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16998,16991,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16991,328,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific actionable problem regarding the `FailedRecoverTaskInstanceFactory` not setting the `environmentConfig` for `taskInstance`, along with a clear expected outcome. It is a well-defined feature request, primarily written in English, and does not involve reverting changes or asking vague questions."
16980,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16980,16978,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16978,55,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and actionable problem statement, specifically in the 'How to reproduce' section, which is left blank. Additionally, the explanation provided under 'What you expected to happen' is vague and does not clearly define the expected behavior or context, making it difficult for a developer to start working on a solution."
16923,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16923,16918,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16918,67,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific problem related to user permissions and the expected behavior. It's actionable, not a revert, and focused on a single issue. Additionally, the majority of the content is written in English, making it suitable for a 'Good PR'."
16916,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16916,16914,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16914,169,Good PR,"The issue describes a clear and specific problem related to exception handling in script parameter processing. It provides sufficient context, steps to reproduce, and an example of code that triggers the issue, all of which allow a developer to start working on a fix. It is not a revert, question, or vague request, and it focuses on a single issue."
16873,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16873,16872,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16872,445,Bad PR,"The issue is vague and does not provide enough context or details regarding the specific problem that needs to be addressed. The description 'Avoid using lock frequently' is not actionable or well-defined, making it difficult for a developer to understand what changes are necessary. Additionally, it does not focus on a single, clear issue."
16892,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16892,16891,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16891,389,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and actionable description of the problem or the feature. Additionally, the explanations provided are vague and do not detail how to implement the changes. There is also no response in the Design Detail, Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan, or Test Plan sections, which further contributes to its lack of clarity and actionable content. Furthermore, the request seems to focus on removing a feature rather than defining a new one, potentially fitting the 'not a revert' criteria but failing to present a well-defined request."
16875,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/16875,16834,https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/16834,518,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a description, which makes it unclear and not actionable. There's only a vague use case provided without enough context or specific details to guide a developer on how to implement the feature. Additionally, it does not focus on a well-defined problem, and there are no related issues or discussions to provide further clarity or context."

It does not clearly define a single, well-focused feature or problem to address. While it is a relevant concern, without a clear outline of how a developer can tackle it, it does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
