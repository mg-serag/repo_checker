It lacks a clear request for resolving a defined problem or implementing a new feature. Furthermore, it doesn't focus on a single issue, as it discusses multiple related aspects without a clear objective. Additionally, the text includes detailed reproduction steps but does not explicitly state a desired outcome or next steps for improvement."
