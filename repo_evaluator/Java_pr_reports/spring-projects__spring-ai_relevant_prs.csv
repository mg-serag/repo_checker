2134,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/pull/2134,2095,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/issues/2095,84,Bad PR,"The issue is vague and lacks a clear and actionable description. It doesn't specify what problem needs to be addressed or how to implement the dependency on commons logging. Additionally, it doesn't provide enough context for a developer to start working on it."
1699,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/pull/1699,1679,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/issues/1679,44,Bad PR,"The issue describes a build failure, but it lacks a clear and actionable solution or request for a specific fix. While it identifies a problem, it does not focus on a single, well-defined issue or provide clear steps to resolve it, making it vague. Additionally, it includes a lot of technical information that may confuse rather than guide a developer. Furthermore, the issue makes a request for better communication about breaking changes, which is outside the scope of fixing the current problem."
