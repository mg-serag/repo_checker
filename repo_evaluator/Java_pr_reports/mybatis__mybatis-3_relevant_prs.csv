3388,https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/pull/3388,566,https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/issues/566,55,Bad PR,"The issue is primarily a question asking if myBatis can support oracle nested cursors rather than describing a specific, actionable problem or feature. It falls short of providing the necessary context or a clear request for a change, which makes it unsuitable for a 'Good PR'."
3108,https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/pull/3108,101,https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/issues/101,607,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific problem regarding MyBatis constructor injection and its limitations with `<collection>` in resultMaps. It provides sufficient context, including code examples and expected behavior, making it actionable for a developer to work on. The request is focused on a single issue, does not aim to revert any changes, and is written primarily in English."
