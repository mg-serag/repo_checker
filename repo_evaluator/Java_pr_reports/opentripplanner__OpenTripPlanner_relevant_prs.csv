6669,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6669,6641,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6641,1269,Good PR,"The issue is clear and actionable as it describes a specific problem with the interpolation logic in the API and data modeling, providing detailed context and examples of current behaviors. It is not a revert, and it focuses on a single well-defined problem: the need for a major rewrite of interpolation logic. The issue is primarily written in English and does not pose a vague request or question."
6493,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6493,6188,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6188,573,Bad PR,"The issue does not provide a clear and actionable problem or feature; it is vague, lacks specific details about the desired solution, and does not offer enough context to begin implementation. Additionally, it indicates uncertainty about the requirements with phrases like 'we have not looked into what we want to do', which makes it hard to define a single issue focus."
6653,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6653,6048,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6048,638,Bad PR,"The issue is a general task list for technical debt during an event, which lacks a clear, specific, and actionable problem statement or feature request. It is more of a collection of tasks without clear ownership, and it involves multiple tasks instead of focusing on a single well-defined issue."
6665,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6665,6654,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6654,168,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific problem with the `stopTimesForPattern` GraphQL call returning duplicate entries. It provides enough context (the query and the sample response) for a developer to understand the issue and begin working on a fix. It does not involve reverting changes, asking questions, or containing vague requests, and it focuses on a single identifiable problem."
6510,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6510,6467,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6467,1125,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a specific, actionable problem or feature. Instead, it discusses the context of TRIAS and mentions a conclusion from a developer meeting without providing detailed steps or requirements for implementation. Additionally, the primary focus seems to be on exploring the use of OTP rather than a single, well-defined feature request or problem to solve."
6628,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6628,6609,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6609,49,Bad PR,"The issue describes a NullPointerException that occurred after an upgrade but does not clearly define a specific problem or feature request for others to address. It lacks actionable steps or context for resolution, making it vague and more of a description of an error rather than a focused issue for development. Additionally, it references a prior issue without identifying a single problem to solve, and therefore does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
6611,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6611,6531,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6531,715,Good PR,"The issue presents a specific problem with street routing, including expected and observed behaviors, relevant version information, and steps to reproduce the issue.

6558,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6558,45,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/45,652,Bad PR,"The issue is vague and raises multiple questions without providing a clear, actionable problem or specific feature request to address. It includes various topics and issues, making it unfocused and not suitable for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, parts of the issue are phrased as questions and suggestions rather than definitive problem statements."
6599,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6599,6572,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6572,36,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem regarding the independent parameters for scooter_rental and bike_rental modes in OpenTripPlanner. It outlines the expected and observed behaviors clearly, provides documentation references, and details reproducible steps. This clarity makes it actionable and focused on a single issue."
6421,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6421,5463,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/5463,299,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem with the flex routing engine not honoring 'bannedAgencies' and 'bannedRoutes', making it clear and actionable. It focuses on a single issue, does not request a revert, and is predominantly in English. The context is sufficient for a developer to start working on a solution."
6535,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6535,6534,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6534,400,Bad PR,"The issue provides a stack trace of an IllegalArgumentException but lacks a clear, actionable problem statement or feature request. It primarily describes an observed behavior without specifying steps to resolve it or potential solutions. Additionally, it does not focus on closing a single, well-defined problem and expresses difficulty in reproducing the error, which further complicates the ability to create a meaningful PR. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
6397,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6397,6340,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6340,147,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to SIRI feed support for 'ScheduledStopPoint' references, providing sufficient background, design proposals, and key data flows.

6423,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6423,5630,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/5630,210,Bad PR,"The issue is mainly a ticket for discussion and does not present a specific, actionable problem or feature that a developer can start working on. It lacks clear direction and appears to be vague in nature, which does not support a focused implementation."

It does not request a revert, and it is focused on resolving a single well-defined issue, which makes it suitable for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, the issue is primarily written in English."
6250,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6250,6226,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6226,46,Good PR,"The issue presents a clear and actionable problem regarding the validation of the trip_id in real-time feeds. It provides a specific solution that can be implemented, focuses on a single feature request, and its content is primarily in English.

6249,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/6249,6048,https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/6048,231,Bad PR,"The issue is not clear and actionable as it is largely a list of tasks related to technical debt during an upcoming developer event. It lacks a specific, well-defined problem or feature request, and instead serves as a general task management list for a group effort. Additionally, it contains several unrelated tasks, violating the single issue focus criterion."
