6385,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/pull/6385,5547,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/5547,386,Good PR,"The issue describes a clear, actionable problem related to deprecating internal annotations and updating dependencies, providing sufficient context for a developer to start working. It focuses on a single well-defined task and is primarily in English. The referenced pull requests further break down the work, enhancing manageability for review."
6296,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/pull/6296,5547,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/5547,283,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific and actionable task to deprecate internal nullability annotations, provides context by linking to relevant documentation, and breaks down the work into manageable parts, making it clear for developers to start working on the implementation."
6270,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/pull/6270,5547,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/5547,98,Good PR,"The issue provides a clear and actionable description of deprecating internal nullability annotations and updating them to conform to JSpecify. It outlines specific tasks in a manageable breakdown, focusing on a well-defined change rather than reverting previous work or posing vague questions. The content is primarily in English, meeting all criteria for a 'Good PR'."
6102,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/pull/6102,6099,https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/6099,134,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly specify a single actionable problem or feature. While it discusses existing functionality and suggests a potential solution, it lacks clarity and specific requirements, making it hard for a developer to start working on it. Additionally, it references an external source without providing sufficient context, which could leave ambiguity in the implementation."
