17264,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/17264,17193,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/17193,48,Bad PR,"The issue appears to be a request for code formatting based on a style guide, rather than a clear and actionable problem or feature. It lacks specificity in describing what changes are required, making it vague. Additionally, it seems to be related to ensuring conformity to a style rather than addressing a specific issue or bug, which does not meet the 'Single Issue Focus' criterion."
17229,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/17229,17167,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/17167,32,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a new, actionable problem or feature but references a duplicate issue (#17163) without providing new insights. Additionally, the body contains significant context that suggests it's intended to confirm a bug rather than propose a solution or feature, which does not align with the criteria for a Good PR."
17220,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/17220,17168,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/17168,59,Bad PR,"The issue lacks clear focus and is overly complicated, proposing multiple steps that could be split into separate issues. The mention of reverting changes in the pom.xml also conflicts with the criteria of not being a revert. Additionally, the request is vague in parts, such as 'to see CI and make further plan,' which does not provide enough actionable detail for a developer to proceed confidently."
16487,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16487,15456,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/15456,22,Bad PR,"The issue lacks clear specificity and actionable steps. It presents a general opinion about improving violation messages without defining a specific problem to address. Additionally, it includes requests for feedback and a broad proposal rather than a concise feature request or bug fix, making it vague and unfocused. Lastly, it is not primarily in English, which affects accessibility for non-English speakers."
17138,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/17138,17120,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/17120,48,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly articulate a specific, actionable problem or feature request. Instead, it provides an execution output of a checkstyle command without outlining what the intended changes or solutions are. It does not focus on a single issue and lacks clarity, making it difficult for a developer to proceed with actionable steps."
16627,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16627,14654,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/14654,23,Bad PR,"The issue body mainly contains a series of commands and outputs related to formatting code and running checks with tools, but it does not describe a specific problem or actionable feature request. It lacks clarity on what needs to be addressed or improved, making it difficult for a developer to determine the focus of the issue. Additionally, it appears to be more of an explanation of a process rather than a request for a concrete change or enhancement."
17019,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/17019,17017,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/17017,160,Bad PR,"The issue does not provide a clear and actionable problem statement; it is vague and lacks sufficient context for a developer to start working on it. While it mentions changing variable names and a configuration update, it does not articulate a specific problem or define the impact of the change. Additionally, it reads like a general suggestion rather than a specific request, which does not meet the clarity and focus criteria for a 'Good PR'."
16967,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16967,11249,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/11249,47,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to inconsistent comment formats in BDD and documentation comments. It provides clear actionable steps to address these inconsistencies by adding `RegexpSingleline` modules to associated configs, making it suitable for a focused pull request. The request is not about reverting changes, asking a question, or vague; it clearly identifies a single issue for developers to tackle."
16423,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16423,14697,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/14697,148,Bad PR,"The issue presents a vague request that lacks clear actionability. While it discusses a problem regarding the `@link` tag validity in Javadoc comments, it does not provide a specific, actionable problem or feature that a developer can directly address. The issue includes multiple examples and details but ultimately does not define a single, well-structured problem for resolution. Additionally, it could benefit from clearer articulation of the expected behavior and a specific proposed solution."
15933,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/15933,6207,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/6207,36,Good PR,"The issue provides a clear and actionable request to expand XPath IT regression tests for all checks that support it. It specifies the requirements for testing, including the needed structure, examples, and links to relevant resources. The issue focuses on a single defined task, does not ask a question or request documentation, and is primarily written in English. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
16030,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16030,6207,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/6207,56,Good PR,"The issue is clear and actionable, describing the need to expand XPath IT Regression tests for specific checks, with concrete examples and guidelines on test structure. It does not request a revert, is focused on a single feature enhancement, and is primarily in English, meeting the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
16236,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16236,6207,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/6207,54,Good PR,"The issue clearly outlines a specific and actionable problem regarding the expansion of XPath IT Regression tests for various checks, providing detailed instructions on the requirements for testing. It specifies the number of test methods needed, examples, naming conventions for input files, and links to necessary documentation. The issue is focused on a single objective and does not involve reverting changes, asking questions, or making vague requests."
16135,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16135,15456,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/15456,22,Bad PR,"The issue is somewhat vague in that it describes a preference rather than a clear and specific actionable problem or feature. While it suggests improvements regarding violation messages, it does not clearly define the technical changes needed or the motivation behind them in a concise manner. Additionally, it ends with an open-ended request for thoughts, indicating it's not fully actionable or focused. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
16210,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16210,15456,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/15456,24,Bad PR,"The issue is somewhat vague and does not clearly articulate a specific, actionable problem or feature request. It expresses a personal opinion and requests community input, which makes it more of a discussion than a well-defined task. Furthermore, it's not focused on a single issue as it mentions multiple checks and the overarching concept of adding messages without clearly specifying any particular implementation tasks. Additionally, the request lacks clarity on how to approach the changes mentioned."
16194,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16194,15456,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/15456,25,Bad PR,"The issue is unclear and lacks specificity in outlining what needs to be changed. While it mentions a desire for all message violations to be specified, it does not provide an actionable problem statement or a clear feature request. Additionally, the phrasing includes vague elements, such as asking for thoughts and not asserting a defined task. It also mixes multiple ideas and includes external links without clear context, making it harder for developers to understand the single focus needed for a 'Good PR'."
16159,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/16159,16155,https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/16155,31,Bad PR,"The issue is unclear and somewhat vague, primarily focusing on a broad request to avoid old JDK API usage without providing specific actionable steps or well-defined objectives. The mention of investigation and a revert request indicates uncertainty about the direction. Additionally, the comments about violations and item migration are too broad and lack focus on a single issue or feature request."
