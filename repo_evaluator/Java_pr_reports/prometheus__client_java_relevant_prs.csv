1192,https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/pull/1192,1189,https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/issues/1189,151,Bad PR,"The issue primarily describes a specific breaking change in a previous release and its effects, which is more of a report on an existing problem rather than a request for a new feature or a specific fix. It does not suggest an actionable solution or clear next steps for a developer to work on, making it not suitable for a 'Good PR'."
