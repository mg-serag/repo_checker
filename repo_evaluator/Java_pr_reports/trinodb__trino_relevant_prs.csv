24904,https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/24904,24570,https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/24570,204,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and actionable problem or feature description. It appears to reference a discussion without providing context, which makes it vague and not focused on a specific task. Additionally, the content does not provide enough information for a developer to start working on it."
25331,https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/25331,25303,https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/25303,31,Bad PR,"The issue does not provide a clear and actionable problem or feature, as it contains uncertainty about the approach and asks for recommendations on the right way to resolve the issue. This indicates a lack of clear direction for a developer to start working on. Additionally, it mentions 'not sure if this is the right approach,' which suggests vagueness rather than a well-defined problem."
