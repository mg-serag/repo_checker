10138,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/pull/10138,10083,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/issues/10083,220,Bad PR,"The issue presents a large, multi-phase task that resembles an Epic rather than a single, well-defined problem. While it includes actionable items, the scope is too broad and includes a request for additional thoughts and possible solutions, which makes it less focused. Additionally, it contains a list of modules that may lead to further breakdowns rather than a single clear issue. This does not align with the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
10081,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/pull/10081,8467,https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/issues/8467,309,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly describe a specific, actionable problem or feature. It references a StackOverflow post without providing sufficient context, and it appears to be a vague request rather than a well-defined feature request. Additionally, the mention of it being a sub-task of another issue suggests it may not be focused on a single, well-defined problem."
