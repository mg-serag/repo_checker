12537,https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12537,12437,https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/12437,246,Bad PR,"The issue describes a specific problem (date handling in JabRef), but it lacks sufficient context on how to implement a solution or specific feature request. It is also somewhat technical with jargon and does not fully meet the criteria for being clear and actionable for developers who might stumble upon it. Additionally, there isn't a well-defined resolution path outlined."
12071,https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/12071,10868,https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/10868,175,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to the missing `langid` field in the entry editor, which is actionable for a developer. It provides context about the field's importance, points to relevant documentation, and suggests a place for it in the UI. It is not a request to revert changes, does not pose a question or vague request, focuses on a single issue, and is primarily in English."
