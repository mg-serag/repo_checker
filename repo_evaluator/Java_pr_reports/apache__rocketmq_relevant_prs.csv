9256,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9256,9254,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9254,2563,Bad PR,"The issue is not clear and actionable as it repeats the same vague statement about complexity without providing specific details on what needs to be done or how to implement it. It lacks a well-defined problem or feature request, does not offer alternatives, and fails to provide sufficient context for a developer to start working on it."

It provides a concrete example, detailed reproduction steps, and specifies a solution, which aligns well with the criteria for a Good PR."
9247,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9247,9246,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9246,41,Bad PR,"The issue lacks clear and actionable details, as it only states 'Add new feature' without specifying what the feature is or its purpose. Additionally, it does not provide enough context or describe the problem sufficiently, making it difficult for a developer to start working on it."
9192,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9192,9191,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9191,464,Good PR,"The issue provides a clear and actionable enhancement request with detailed motivation and a specific solution outlined.

9173,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9173,9172,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9172,75,Bad PR,"The issue lacks clarity and specificity; it doesn't provide sufficient context about the problem or how to implement the solution. The request is repetitive and does not explore any alternatives or give detailed insights, failing to meet the criteria for a good issue."
9153,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9153,9152,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9152,115,Bad PR,"The issue lacks sufficient detail to be actionable. While it identifies a specific enhancement (supporting multiple topics), it doesn't clearly describe the solution ('add field' is too vague) or provide context on how this would be implemented. Additionally, the lack of alternatives considered and insufficient explanation in the 'Additional Context' section weakens the clarity and focus of the request."
9113,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9113,9112,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9112,97,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific performance bug related to the rocksdb seek API, provides sufficient context, outlines problems and expected results, and includes steps to reproduce. It is focused on a well-defined issue rather than being a question or a simple request, and is primarily written in English."
9101,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9101,9105,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9105,31,Good PR,"The issue is clear and actionable, providing a specific problem related to message duplication in RocketMQ. It describes the expected and actual behavior, and specifies the environment details which enable a developer to reproduce the issue easily.

9071,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9071,9069,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9069,210,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to a bug encountered during stress testing, providing clear reproduction steps and context. It does not ask a question or request a revert, focuses on a single issue, and appears to be primarily in English. Therefore, it qualifies as a 'Good PR'."
9027,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9027,9028,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/9028,54,Bad PR,"The issue lacks specific, actionable details about which SYSTEM_ERROR codes need to be changed and how, making it unclear and not well-defined. It does not describe the desired meaningful error code or provide a clear solution, which fails the 'Clear and Actionable' criterion."
8975,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8975,8974,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8974,674,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific feature request to expose an API for recalling scheduled messages, outlining the limitations of the current system and detailing a user-friendly solution.

8915,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8915,8829,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8829,495,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem with the current implementation of LMQ regarding its resource cost and scalability, and it proposes a clear solution of implementing a key-value based design. It is actionable, focused on a single issue, and does not involve reverting changes, asking questions, or being vague. However, the lack of additional context could be a minor concern."
8977,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8977,8976,https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8976,96,Bad PR,"The issue does not provide a clear and actionable description as it lacks detailed context regarding the specific changes needed for the `fileSegment` constructor. Additionally, while it discusses modifying the constructor, it does not clarify how this change will improve management of the thread pool or offer alternative solutions effectively. The issue also includes text in a different language, which violates the requirement of being primarily in English."
