It focuses on a single issue and provides sufficient context for a developer to start working on it, meeting all criteria for a 'Good PR'."
11933,https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/11933,11737,https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11737,65,Bad PR,"The issue body lacks clarity and does not provide a specific, actionable problem or feature for a developer to work on. It contains vague statements about missing validations and uncertainties in the code without clearly articulating what needs to be fixed or implemented. Additionally, it discusses multiple concerns and does not focus on a single well-defined issue."
