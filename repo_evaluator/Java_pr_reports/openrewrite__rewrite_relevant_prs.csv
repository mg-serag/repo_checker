4916,https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/pull/4916,4246,https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues/4246,841,Bad PR,"The issue does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR' as it primarily discusses a potential styling issue with JSON formatting. It appears to be a vague request for help and mentions that the user 'thinks' it's a styling issue without providing a clearly defined problem to fix. Additionally, it includes a question about whether JSON styling is supported, which implies uncertainty rather than a clear, actionable problem."
