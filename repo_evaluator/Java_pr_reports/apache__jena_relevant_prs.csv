It provides historical context about the ARP parsers and their deprecation without outlining a clear issue or request for change, nor does it focus on a single, well-defined problem. It seems more informational than actionable."

2937,https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2937,2936,https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2936,293,Bad PR,"The issue lacks clear and actionable details about the specific changes needed to implement the new jena-iri3986 package. It mentions the existing parser and validator but does not provide enough context or specific steps for a developer to start work. Additionally, the reference to a related issue '#2800' does not clarify the action to be taken here, making it vague."

2959,https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2959,1720,https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1720,175,Bad PR,"The issue presents a problem regarding the output of generalized RDF and suggests a feature to introduce a flag for filtering, which is a clear and actionable request. However, the last section where the author expresses uncertainty about where to implement the solution and states 'Perhaps?' implies vagueness and indecision about contributing, which diminishes the clarity of the issue. Additionally, the overall request leans towards being a vague feature request rather than a strong commitment to providing a solution, thus not fully meeting the criteria for a 'Good PR'."

While it provides some context, it does not meet the criteria of being actionable, as it does not specify what changes are needed to resolve the issue. Additionally, the issue seems somewhat vague and teetering toward a question regarding the behavior of `QueryTransformOps`, which makes it unsuitable for a 'Good PR'."
2901,https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2901,2896,https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2896,139,Bad PR,"The issue is vague and expresses uncertainty about whether the behavior is a bug or a misunderstanding, which does not provide a clear, actionable problem for developers to work on. It lacks a definitive request for a specific feature or bug fix, and the user expresses hesitance about making a pull request ('Maybe'). Additionally, there is ambiguity in the problem description, making it not suitable for a 'Good PR'."

It is more of a user question about an error encountered while running a query, rather than a well-defined issue to be resolved. Additionally, it does not adhere to the criteria for being a focused single issue."
