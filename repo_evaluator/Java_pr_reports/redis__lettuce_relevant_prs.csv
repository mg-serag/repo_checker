3118,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/pull/3118,1310,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/issues/1310,66,Bad PR,"The issue contains vague language and poses a question rather than presenting a clear and actionable problem or feature request. It seeks to understand a design decision rather than defining a well-defined issue to be addressed, which does not align with the criteria for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, it mixes problem description with a suggestion and questions, making it less focused."
3170,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/pull/3170,3168,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/issues/3168,95,Bad PR,"The issue is vague and lacks a clear, actionable problem statement. It does not provide a concise description of the behavior or expected outcomes, and while it mentions an upgrade and error, the details are not well-defined enough to guide development. Additionally, the issue body includes many screenshots without a robust explanation of the problem and lacks specific code or context to reproduce the error effectively."
3169,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/pull/3169,3168,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/issues/3168,95,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and concise description of the exact problem encountered during the use of reactor mode with the upgraded Lettuce version. It contains vague references to missing JSON string versions and includes multiple screenshots without providing detailed context or actionable steps for resolution. Additionally, the expected behavior/code section is not filled out, which diminishes clarity. Overall, it does not meet the criteria for being clear and actionable."
3049,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/pull/3049,3048,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/issues/3048,22,Bad PR,"The issue presents a potential bug but includes a question asking for clarification on whether the omission of RedisJsonAsyncCommands is intentional. This makes it a vague request rather than a clear and actionable problem to be resolved, which does not align with the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
3027,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/pull/3027,3009,https://github.com/redis/lettuce/issues/3009,57,Good PR,"The issue clearly describes a specific problem with the Redis WATCH command when used inside a MULTI block, provides a detailed example of the current behavior and expected behavior, and includes relevant code that demonstrates the bug. It is focused on a single issue, does not request a revert, question, or documentation, and is primarily written in English."
