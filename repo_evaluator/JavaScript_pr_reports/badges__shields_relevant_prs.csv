10245,https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10245,5548,https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/5548,292,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a specific, actionable problem or feature for developers to work on. Instead, it discusses the existence of a new package manager without a clear goal or defined task, leading to ambiguity. Additionally, it does not focus on a single issue, as it introduces multiple topics without actionable outcomes."
10935,https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10935,10921,https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10921,45,Bad PR,"The issue lacks a clear and actionable description, as it poses questions about catalog structures instead of defining a specific problem or feature. It does not directly request a change or provide a solution, and it appears to be more of an inquiry rather than a focused issue. Additionally, it does not meet the requirement for an issue that is primarily in English, given the presence of multiple URL references without explanations."
10878,https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10878,10285,https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10285,31,Good PR,"The issue describes a clear and actionable problem regarding the `logoWidth` parameter, proposing its removal and providing context as to why it should be eliminated. It specifies that the change should not throw an error if the parameter is passed and suggests removing it from the documentation, aligning with the single issue focus and clarity criteria. Additionally, the issue is primarily in English and is not a request to revert changes."
10790,https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10790,9256,https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/9256,119,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a specific actionable problem or feature; instead, it is mainly a discussion or awareness post about the potential impact of Reddit API changes. It lacks clarity and defined context for developers to take action, does not focus on a single issue, and does not provide clear guidance for a PR."
