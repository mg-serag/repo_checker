4658,https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/pull/4658,4573,https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/issues/4573,56,Good PR,"The issue is clear and actionable, describing a specific problem with the seek functionality in Dash.js with concrete steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and context regarding the environment and setup. It is focused on a single issue related to video playback, and the majority of the content is written in English."
4657,https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/pull/4657,4651,https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/issues/4651,50,Bad PR,"The issue provides details on an error encountered when using Dash.js but lacks a clear and actionable problem description that a developer can directly address. It does not specify a solution or feature request, focuses on a bug in a previous version rather than a new feature, and does not maintain a single issue focus as it compares behavior across versions. Additionally, while primarily in English, the context and actionable insights are insufficient for a 'Good PR'."
