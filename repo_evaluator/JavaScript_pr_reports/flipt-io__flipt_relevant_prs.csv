4238,https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/pull/4238,4235,https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/issues/4235,817,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly define a specific problem to be addressed or a feature to be implemented. It merely describes a series of steps leading to a situation without explaining the expected outcome or the impact of the issue. Additionally, the language used is somewhat vague, and it lacks the necessary detail for a developer to start working on it effectively."
