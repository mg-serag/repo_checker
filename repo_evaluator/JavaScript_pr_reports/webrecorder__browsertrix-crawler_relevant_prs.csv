806,https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/pull/806,784,https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/issues/784,31,Bad PR,"The issue is primarily asking a question regarding cache-clearing commands for the crawler, which makes it vague and not actionable. It does not provide a specific problem or feature to work on, nor is it clearly focused on a single well-defined issue."
757,https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/pull/757,132,https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/issues/132,215,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to page fetch failures and proposes a clear and actionable solution involving a retry strategy. It is focused on a single feature request regarding error handling in crawling, does not suggest reverting previous changes, and is primarily written in English. Overall, it provides enough context for a developer to start working on the implementation."
