323,https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/pull/323,317,https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/issues/317,56196,Bad PR,"The issue describes a requirement but lacks a specific, actionable problem or feature description. It does not delineate how the change would be implemented or what specific issues need addressing within the plugin. Additionally, it appears to be somewhat vague regarding the scope of the changes required, which does not align with the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
