7370,https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/pull/7370,7345,https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/issues/7345,74,Bad PR,"The issue does not clearly describe a specific, actionable problem or feature. It primarily outlines a bug scenario but lacks a concise summary of the expected behavior versus the actual behavior. The context provided is somewhat vague and overly detailed without a clear action for the developer to address, making it less suitable for a 'Good PR'."
