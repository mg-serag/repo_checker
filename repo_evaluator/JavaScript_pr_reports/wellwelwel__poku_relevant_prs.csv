907,https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/pull/907,801,https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/issues/801,151,Bad PR,"The issue body primarily serves as a description of planned updates and migration instructions for a project rather than addressing a specific, actionable problem or feature request. While it outlines a roadmap, it does not focus on a singular well-defined issue that a developer can work on, thus failing to meet the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
888,https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/pull/888,801,https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/issues/801,71,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a specific, actionable problem or feature but instead outlines a broad plan for major updates and migration to the next version of Poku. It lacks focus on a single issue and provides unclear context for developers to start working on, which does not align with the criteria for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, it includes multiple planned changes and tasks that go beyond a well-defined problem or feature request."
