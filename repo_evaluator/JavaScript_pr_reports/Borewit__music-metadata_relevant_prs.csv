2452,https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata/pull/2452,2286,https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata/issues/2286,318,Bad PR,"The issue is primarily a question about a specific functionality of the library (extracting video details from a file) rather than a clear and actionable request for a feature or bug fix. It does not outline a specific problem that can be resolved but rather seeks clarification on existing functionality, which falls outside the scope of a 'Good PR'. Additionally, it is vague in terms of providing a well-defined problem to address."
2389,https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata/pull/2389,2387,https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata/issues/2387,40,Good PR,"The issue describes a specific problem related to an error message that could be improved by including more context about the file type. It provides enough detail for a developer to understand the problem and suggests a clear enhancement, making it actionable. It does not request a revert, is not vague, focuses on a single enhancement, and is primarily written in English."
