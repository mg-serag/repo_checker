1986,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/pull/1986,319,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/issues/319,545,Good PR,"The issue provides a clear and actionable problem, outlining the need for a rollback feature in service deployment due to bugs introduced in recent versions. It specifies a well-defined solution and offers context with relevant examples. The issue does not request a revert to previous changes, nor is it a vague question or request. It is focused on a single feature—rollback functionality—and is primarily in English."
1613,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/pull/1613,1612,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/issues/1612,451,Bad PR,"While the issue describes a specific feature request and outlines a clear solution, it does not meet the criteria of being actionable enough for a developer to start working on, especially since the author mentions needing help and states 'Maybe, need help.' This implies a lack of confidence or clarity that undermines its suitability for a 'Good PR'. Additionally, the issue includes no contextual information, which is necessary to fully evaluate the request."
1523,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/pull/1523,1333,https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/issues/1333,1492,Bad PR,"The issue lacks sufficient details and context to define a clear and actionable solution. The request for a feature to add Gitea as a git provider is vague, and the author expresses uncertainty about sending a PR, indicating they may not have a solid plan for implementation. Additionally, there is no concrete information on the specific functionality expected, making it difficult for a developer to begin working on this request."
