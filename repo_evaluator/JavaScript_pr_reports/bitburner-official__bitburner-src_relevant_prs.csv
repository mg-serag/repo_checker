1773,https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/pull/1773,1730,https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/issues/1730,191,Bad PR,"The issue does not describe a specific, actionable problem or feature; instead, it discusses the number of lint errors and plans to create multiple PRs without providing a clear, singular task to address. It also refers to previous PRs without specifying what changes need to be made, making it vague. Additionally, it appears to focus on a series of adaptations rather than a single issue."
