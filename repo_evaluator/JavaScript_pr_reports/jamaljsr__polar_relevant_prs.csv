1040,https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/1040,986,https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/issues/986,381,Bad PR,"The issue describes a specific behavior in the GUI related to the display of decimal values when minting a Taproot Asset, but it is marked as a minor issue and does not provide a concrete, actionable solution or request for implementation. Additionally, it ends with 'just FYI,' which implies it is more of an informational note rather than a clear feature request or bug fix. The focus appears to be vague and does not fully meet the criteria for a 'Good PR.'"
