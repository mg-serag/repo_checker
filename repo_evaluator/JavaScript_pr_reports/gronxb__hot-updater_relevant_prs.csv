440,https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater/pull/440,439,https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater/issues/439,59,Good PR,"The issue is clearly defined with a specific problem regarding the failure of `expo prebuild --platform android` in Android-only projects. It provides a detailed description of the problem, the expected behavior, and a well-thought-out proposed solution with specific code changes. The issue is single-focused, actionable, and not a revert or a vague request. Additionally, the content is primarily in English, fulfilling all the criteria for a 'Good PR'."
388,https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater/pull/388,321,https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater/issues/321,869,Bad PR,"The issue describes a specific problem about not being able to delete an old channel, but it is framed as a request for help rather than an actionable problem or feature implementation. It does not meet the criteria for a 'Good PR' because it reads more like a user question and lacks a clear path for development work."
