# TODO: Main Workflow Orchestration
#
# This file needs to be updated to orchestrate the entire repository evaluation workflow.
# The following two major tasks need to be implemented:
#
# TASK 1: ORCHESTRATE THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW
# =======================================
# - Modify individual scripts to support orchestration from main.py
# - Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
# - Add configuration management for the entire workflow
# - Ensure proper sequencing of all stages:
#   1. Repository scanning (scan_github_repos.py)
#   2. Logical repository checks (logical_repo_checks.py)
#   3. Agentic PR checks (agentic_pr_checker.py)
#   4. Labeling tool data synchronization (update_from_LT.py)
# - Add progress tracking and reporting
# - Implement resume capability for interrupted workflows
#
# TASK 2: INCORPORATE REPOSITORY SCANNING AND SHEET TRANSFER
# ==========================================================
# - Integrate scan_github_repos.py into the main workflow
# - Implement automatic sheet transfer logic:
#   * If a repository is identified as Python majority but is in Java sheet ‚Üí transfer to Python sheet
#   * If a repository is identified as Java majority but is in JS/TS sheet ‚Üí transfer to Java sheet
#   * Apply similar logic for all language combinations
# - Add language detection validation before transfer
# - Implement duplicate detection across sheets
# - Add logging and audit trail for transfers
# - Ensure data integrity during transfers
#
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# - Each script should be modified to accept parameters for orchestration
# - Consider using a configuration file for workflow settings
# - Add proper logging and monitoring capabilities
# - Implement rollback mechanisms for failed transfers
# - Add validation to prevent data loss during transfers
